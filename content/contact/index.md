## Take Action

### Be a Part of the Change

Calling dreamers and doers. There are many ways to join in on the efforts to bring the OurParadise vision to life. Come to Zanzibar to collaborate in-person, buy EDEN (see below), or support from afar.

Please note **we are now primarily focused on raising $3M in order to fully acquire Mbweni Ruins and Jungle Paradise**. Today we are already operating from this location.

# A Token for Co-Ownership

We are introducing a token called EDEN. EDEN Tokens are not crypto currencies, they are pre-purchase tokens of OurParadise and represent ownership/utilization in the ecosystem. You can always re-sell your EDEN tokens or use them to participate in the OurParadise World.

# Not For Profit

The OurParadise locations will be owned by not-for-profit entities to make sure that all stays protected for ever. All assets are owned by non profits but the utilization is 100% for OurParadise for 33-66-99 years (renewable). This allows us to create value for the future of our planet and ourselves.

# A Bigger Picture

OurParadise is part of a collection of impact projects focused on planet and people first. We collectively believe that doing business and doing good for the world can go hand in hand.
