 ## Welcome to OurParadise
 
 ### A Co-Owned Abundance-Based System

 <br>

 Our mission is to conserve and protect unique locations around the world by promoting eco-tourism and eco-education and the preservation and empowerment of local cultures, starting in Zanzibar and Tanzania.<br><br>We strive to raise awareness of the importance of environmental and cultural conservation, and to inspire people to take action to regenerate our planet and to protect, empower, and learn from local peoples and their traditions.

 <!-- What if we together create a new "paradise” system not based on scarcity and fear of missing out, but based on trust and abundance? An interconnected network of homes where we can always go to find healing, like-minded people, and safety. -->
