## Welcome to OurParadise
 
### A Co-Living Community for Change-Makers & Digital Nomads

On the west coast of Zanzibar sits a beautiful and historical community space for eco-tourism, co-working, and co-living. A place for like-minded people to gather, share authentic moments, and build our future together.

*We invite you to use the chat on the bottom-right of your screen to talk to a human. We're pleased to assist!*
