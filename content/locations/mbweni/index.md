Today, this location is an operational eco-friendly boutique hotel in front of one of the absolute nicest beaches at this side of the island

The resort is a quiet, beach-front jungle hideaway, a home to more than 280 different tree species (including 80  different types of palm trees).

The resort is also the HQ of OurWorld Concept – an innovative approach to co-creating a better, more regenerative world. The resort will be used to come together with change makers from around the globe, in combination with our retreats on the Nile.

The Mbweni Ruins & Gardens are unbelievably rich from a historical perspective. They are home to amazing ruins dating from 1870 – which are perfect for events and gatherings – and the plan is to transform the ruins back to their original glory.

A healing center will be built and will host incredible technology (both ancient and new wisdom) for body, mind, and spirit . The therapies available are literally life saving or complete rejuvenation.
