### Chumbe Island

<p>
With OurParadise, we are initiating a series of conservation projects to preserve the marine and natural surroundings of Chumbe Island.
</p>

<br>

<p>
To protect the biodiversity of the East African marine region and the preservation of Chumbe’s important function as a fisheries nursery ground, we would first enforce a 55-hectare Coral Reef Sanctuary and a 17-hectare protected forest reserve, as well as strengthen marine and park authority patrols around the area to safeguard the wildlife from the prevailing risk of wildlife poaching. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
Zanzibari community members from neighboring fishing villages will also gain knowledge and practical insights in nature and wildlife conservation through Chumbe’s extensive environmental education program which will positively impact compliance to marine protected area regulations.
