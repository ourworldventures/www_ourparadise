### Mbweni Ruins

<p>The Historic Ruins of the Mbweni School for freed slaves founded in 1874, with associations with Sir John Kirk, Zanzibar’s first scientific botanist. Kirk (1832 – 1922) was also instrumental in the ending of the East African Slave Trade. He was resident in Zanzibar for 20 years from 1866-1886.</p>
<br>
<p>Near Mbweni Ruins is St John's Anglican Church, another thought-provoking reminder of the colonial missionary era. The caretaker-guide is a direct descendant of a freed slave who became the UMCA's first African deacon (junior priest).</p>
<br>
<p>Our aim is to restore the ruins to their old glory and revive it as an education center. We will also integrate the old church.</p>
